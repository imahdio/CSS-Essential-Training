# 03-The Box Model
## Introduction to the box model
>-CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the web. It's set of rules that defines how elements are sized, the total amount of space they take up and where they are positioned in relation to each other.  
-In this chapter we'll talk about how elements occupy space based on the type of element, inline or block.  
>-These are five properties that make up the box model:  
>1. Width
>2. height
>3. padding
>4. margin
>5. border 

incorporate-take in or contain (something) as part of a whole
## Inline, block, and display
>-there are two main types of HTML elements: inline and block-level  
>-❶ inline elements like `<a> `, `<span>` , `<strong>`
>1. take up the same space as the content contained within their tags.
>2. are displayed in a line, side by side, starting from the left.
>3. The element's content will only wrap to the next line if the content can't fit on the same line within its container(parent element or viewport).
>
>-❷ block elements like `<p>` , `<h1>` , `<article>` , `<section>`
>1. same height as content , same width as container(parent element or viewport)
>2. always starts on a new line and stack on top of each other
>3. the majority of elements are block-level.
>
>-check if an element is block or inline ([experiment with example code in here](https://codepen.io/christinatruong/pen/zXvQZE?editors=1100)):
><table>
>    <tr><th>add two elements next to each other</th><th>add a background color to the element</th><th>add<code>width</code>and<code>height</code>or<code>margine</code></th>
>    </tr>
>    <tr><td><ul><li>if start another line is block level</li><li>if it displays on the same line is inline level</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>if the color stretches all the way across the container(parent element or viewport), it's a block element</li><li>If it only spans the width of the actual content, then it's an inline element.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li><code>width</code>and<code>height</code>change the size of the element for block elements and<code>margine</code>take effect absolutly</li><li>adding<code>width</code>and<code>height</code>has no effect for inline elements ,<code>margine</code>only take effect on right and left side of the inline elements</li></ul></td>
>    </tr>
></table>
>
>-the `display` property change the default behavior of inline and block-level elements, using a value of `block`, `inline`, or `inline-block`.

><b>Notice</b>: For any block-level element, I can apply a `text-align: center;` to the element itself or I can add it to the container so all the elements will inherit this style.  
>-separating content from style means instead of picking an HTML element that looks a particular way, choose the most semantic element for the content, and then change the display with CSS.

## The box model properties
>-The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for each HTML element which consist of:
>1. content box: contains the actual content added between the HTML tags, such as text or an image includes 2 following properties:
>    1. `width` property: sets the width of the content area
>    2. `height` property: sets the height of the content area
>2. `padding` property: adds or removes the space within the element. It surrounds the content area, and this space is included inside of the element.
>3. `border` property: adds between padding and margin. It surrounds the padding area.
>4. `margin` property: adds or removes space around the element. it surrounds the entire element.

>-The dimensions of all of these properties can contribute to the total amount of space an element occupies.  
Notice: Margin does not contribute to the total size of the element since it adds space around the element but it does effect the amount of space that the element takes up. [check one example in here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64577273/148698384-5eb8d7a2-ab5f-4083-8b3b-48802bc5dd09.png)

omit-leave out or exclude (someone or something), either intentionally or forgetfully

contribute-If something contributes to an event or situation, it is one of the causes of it
## Debugging the box model
>-there are 2 ways to experiment with the size or spacing of the elements:
>1. change setting the box properties on various elements in CSS file
>2. use the browser developer tools to inspect the element to show the corresponding CSS
>
>-there are 3 ways to inspect a specific element:
>1. hover over on that element in webpage, right-click to open the menu and select inspect.
>2. just select that element from the HTML panel of developer tools to be highlited
>3. use [this pointer icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64577273/148725918-6e1757b3-fd47-469b-b3c5-9946e1dc8d49.png), hover over the element you want to select and click on it.  
>
>-the box model representation is under the Styles or Layout tab in google chrome or firefox respectively. experiment with it through developer tools on [this html](Debugging-the-box-model/box-model.html) file.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64577273/148728367-a6a4be08-a4a7-458e-9eee-5bf71316e4b3.png)  
**Notice:** there is no default margin space on the left and right side of above demonstrated margin box, and that's why the values say zero in it.  
**Notice:** You can even edit CSS properties values to experiment right in the browser. Refresh the browser to reset the changes that you made in the Dev tool.  
-if you hover over the various properties on visual demonstartion of box model, it will highlight the color-coded corresponding areas, which is super helpful when debugging.  
-<a name="margin-collapsing"></a>margin collapsing **only affects on the top and the bottom margins**. [When I hover over the `H1` in the HTML panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64577273/148741291-3cf926bc-f48c-4ab2-96d5-b70dc2b4c2a7.png), you can see that there is margin on the top and bottom of the element. The margin bottom space stops right above the content box of the `H2`, but [if I hover over the `H2` element](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64577273/148741731-02a093d1-aebf-4347-9b15-47b70b447bbe.png), the margin top stops right below the content box of `H1`. Both of these margins are occupying the same space, even though they're coming from two different elements.

collapse-the process of hiding something or reducing its size, so it's not visible

margine collapsing- The top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin. [check MDN documentation for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing)
## Padding, margin, and border
>-there are 2 ways to distinguish between margin and padding
>1. inspecting each element with developer tools
>2. adding a background color or border to each element
>
><a name="element-total-size"></a>**IMPORTANT Notice**: margin isn't included in the total size of the element. It does push all the surrounding elements away, so it is included in the total area that the element occupies.
>-experiment with [this code snippet](https://codepen.io/ma400/pen/RwLeowy):
>* the space between the first and second paragraph is created by margin collapsing.
>* following CSS declarations remove any margine between first 2 paragraphs:
>```css
>.first {
>  margin-bottom: 0;
>}
>.second {
>  margin-top: 0;
>}
>```
>-add `padding` in `span` tag as inline element. the padding space has been added to the element, but the horizontal position of the element remains.  
-add `margin` in `span` tag as inline element. it actually will only apply to the left and right side [without margin collapsing](#margin-collapsing). if add `display: inline-block`, to the `span` selector, the margin is applied horizontally and vertically.  
-add `margin: 0;` to `span` selector. there's still some space between the inline elements which actually coming from the line break in the html. these solutions are available if you would need to remove the space:
>1. if we put `<span>` tags on the same line, that will remove the space. [result](https://codepen.io/ma400/pen/poWxprq)
>2. use `margin-left` on second `<span>` tag with a negative value. Just to nudge it over. this technique will only work with `margin` because `padding` does not accept negative values. [result](https://codepen.io/ma400/pen/RwLexjg)
>3. make a container just around `<span>` elements. set `font-size: 0;` in parent container. so it reduces all the characters down to zero, including the space. But `font-size` is an inheritable style. So we'll have to re-declare the `font-size` for the child elements to override this inherited style. [result](https://codepen.io/ma400/pen/xxXypME)
>4. But now there are newer layout techniques that will work better for this scenario and will be discussed later on, in this course

quirk-an unusual habit or type of behavior, or something that is strange and unexpected

nudge-the act of pushing someone or something gently

aesthetic-concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty

as if-in such a way that something seems to be true

would need to-*in my point of view* only expressing hope and wish

So aside from aesthetics, another time you would need to remove the space as if you were using inline elements that were a specific width within a specific container size-*in my point of view* another time you want to remove the space of inline elements with a specific width and container size , regradless of attending to appreciation of beauty , use the taught direction of this lesson. [check here for more info](https://github.com/imahdio/CSS-Essential-Training/issues/10)
## Margin and layouts
>-Here are 2 ways that margin can be used for layouts:  
>1. use negative margine values to nudge block element just a little bit outside of its default stacking position.  
>Notice: if you need to move an element to a completely different position on the document, reorder the HTML or use another layout technique.
>
>2. center align block level elements horizontally with defining a width for the element and the margins left and right values are set to auto. this technique is often used to keep the page content from spanning all the way across viewport. try it out on [this example](https://codepen.io/ma400/pen/oNGaRPd) with these steps:
>    1. add a width. Any value to make it smaller than the container. If the element spans all the way across, then there would be no need to center align it.
>    2. top and bottom margin can be any value. then set the left and right values to auto. The remaining space is split evenly between the left and right margins which will center align it.  
>Notice: if set the top and bottom to auto as well, it will not align the element vertically. aligning elements vertically can be achieved with flexbox.
>
>-with the following steps , set background color to expand the entire width of the page, but keep the page content from spanning all the way across viewport
>1. for aligning content, add a `<div>` container with a class around the html content then add `width` and `margin` styles.  
Notice: `<div>` is used here because it has no semantic meaning. It's just being used as a hook for styling purposes.
>2. add `background` style to the whole section

stack of things-a pile of them

nudge-the act of pushing someone or something gently

all the way across-as much as possible or completely, you reach the end of something. [Great definition](https://englishlogica.com/spoken-vocab/go-all-the-way-idiom-meaning-examples-k3r6mg8kkyg)

split evenly-split into equal amounts [Great definition](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/divide-evenly.html)

pose-to cause something, especially a problem or difficulty

hook-something intended to attract and ensnare

ensnare-to catch or get control of something or someone
## Project: Adding content wrappers
>-autocomplete feature write the HTML syntax a little faster. for example, just type in the element name div, without the angled brackets and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>, it will complete it as well as add a class attribute.  
-code collapsing feature is useful for temporarily hiding long blocks of code in IDE to make the file easier to read. click the caret symbol beside line number of any code block, to collapse to code and click to open it again.  
Notice: the feature only works when the code is indented properly.  
-to expand content block only to a width of 800 pixels and stays aligned in the center of the page, while the background color still spans all the way across , follow these steps:
>1. go over to [index.html](Project-adding-content-wrappers/index.html) and add `<div>` content wrapper with the `content-wrap` class inside of header and all sections but around the content. I'm using a `<div>` here because this container has no semantic meaning. We're just adding it for styling purposes in [styles.css](Project-adding-content-wrappers/css/styles.css)  
**Notice:** you can use any other descriptive class name if you'd like.  
**Notice:** Make sure to put the `<div>` just inside of the `<header>` and `<section>` tag and close it just before their closing tag.  
**Notice:** Make sure to indent the content to be nested inside the content wrap.
>2. go over to [styles.css](Project-adding-content-wrappers/css/styles.css) and add `content-wrap` style to global section, since it's going to be reused throughout the page.
>```css
>.content-wrap {
>    width: 800px;
>    margin: 0 auto;
>}
>```
>3. fix up some space around the left and right edge of the page. That's actually coming from the `<body>` element. add `margin: 0` to the body selector to remove that space.  It's also convention to also set `padding: 0` on the body, just to reset the default style.

there you go (there you are)-this is what you wanted

caret-the symbol ^ , found on a keyboard and used in marking text

narrower-to reduce in width or extent

line up someone or something-arrange a number of people or things in a straight row
## Project: Margin and padding
>**Notice:** *based on my test and tries* padding increase the size of element by decreasing the size of margin while keep constant the size of content.
